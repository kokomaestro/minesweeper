<!-- Goal is to click on every tile in an 8 by 8 grid except those that have mines. When a user clicks a tile, one of two things happens.  -->
<!-- If the tile was covering a mine, the mine is revealed and the game ends in failure. If the tile was not covering a mine,  -->
<!-- it instead reveals the number of adjacent (including diagonals) tiles that are covering mines â€“ and, if that number was 0,  -->
<!-- behaves as if the user has clicked on every cell around it. When the user is confident that all tiles not containing mines  -->
<!-- have been clicked, the user presses a Validate button (often portrayed as a smiley-face icon) that checks the clicked tiles:  -->
<!-- if the user is correct, the game ends in victory, if not, the game ends in failure. -->
